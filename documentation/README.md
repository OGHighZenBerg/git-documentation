# GitHub Actions Blueprint

This blueprint provides a set of example GitHub Workflows and documentation to help you get started with automating your software development lifecycle.

## Workflows

The `.github/workflows` directory contains the following example workflows:

*   `simple-workflow.yml`: A simple workflow that demonstrates the basic concepts of GitHub Actions. It is triggered on every push to the `main` branch and runs a script that prints "Hello, World!".
*   `node-ci.yml`: A more advanced workflow that shows a typical Continuous Integration (CI) setup for a Node.js project. It is triggered on every push or pull request to the `main` branch and performs the following steps:
    *   Checks out the code.
    *   Sets up multiple versions of Node.js.
    *   Installs dependencies.
    *   Runs tests.

## How to Use

To use these example workflows, you can copy the files from the `.github/workflows` directory into your own repository. You may need to adapt the workflows to your specific project requirements.

For example, in the `node-ci.yml` workflow, you might want to change the Node.js versions or the test command.
