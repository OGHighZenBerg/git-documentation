# GitHub Actions Adoption Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a plan for adopting GitHub Actions in your projects. It is structured by quarters and includes tasks and milestones to guide you through the process.

## Q1: Getting Started with GitHub Actions

*   **Tasks**:
    *   Read the basic concepts of GitHub Actions (workflows, jobs, steps, actions).
    *   Understand the workflow syntax.
    *   Create a simple "hello world" workflow.
    *   Learn about using existing actions from the GitHub Marketplace.
*   **Milestone**: Successfully run a basic workflow in a repository.

## Q2: CI/CD Implementation

*   **Tasks**:
    *   Set up a CI workflow for a project (e.g., Node.js, Python).
    *   Implement automated testing in the workflow.
    *   Implement a build process in the workflow.
    *   Learn about using secrets for sensitive data.
*   **Milestone**: A fully automated CI pipeline for a project.

## Q3: Advanced Workflows and Deployment

*   **Tasks**:
    *   Learn about more advanced workflow features like matrix builds, reusable workflows, and environments.
    *   Set up a CD (Continuous Deployment) workflow to deploy to a staging environment.
    *   Explore different deployment strategies (e.g., blue-green, canary).
*   **Milestone**: Automated deployment to a staging environment.

## Q4: Optimization and Security

*   **Tasks**:
    *   Learn how to optimize workflow execution time.
    *   Implement security best practices for GitHub Actions (e.g., secret scanning, dependency scanning).
    *   Create custom actions for your organization.
*   **Milestone**: A secure, efficient, and reusable set of workflows for your projects.
